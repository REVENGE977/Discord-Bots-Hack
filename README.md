# Discord Bots Hack


##### How to use ?
1.  Download and configure [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) if not yet
2.  Download the script
3.  Extract it to a directory
4.  Replace the token of the bot, the target server ID and your account ID in the code, in the 'configs' variable
5.  Install the discord.js library in this path:
    ```sh
    user@user:~/path/of/script$ npm install discord.js@11 --save
    ```
6.  Launch the script:
    ```sh
    user@user:~/path/of/file$ node v3.js
    ```

##### Issues :
1. Nothing happens: Verify the bot has permissions in the target server. If not, you know why it doesn't work
2. Got an error when login client: Did you changed the token bythe bot's token ?
3. Got some errors when trying to executing functions: Did you changed the server ID etc... by the real values ?

##### Thank you !
